### Self-taught developer with 3+ yearsâ€™ experience in building and maintaining web and mobile apps â€” every one published and hosted solo.
#### Based in Kolkata, though occasionally spotted in Darjeeling, rebooting at 7,000 feet.

### Skilled in modern, performance-first web and mobile development â€” using proven frameworks and cloud backends to build fast and scalable products ready for real-world use.

### Single source of truth isnâ€™t just a principle â€” itâ€™s a survival tactic. Asking others where things are? No thanks. Trusting others with my code? Even worse. Not bad at teamwork â€” just better without it. A one-man codebase: every line, pixel, and variable crafted solo, obsessively tuned to perfection (with occasional emotional support from autocompletion).
### My source code lives in private repos â€” because forks are for food, not for filchers.

### I want to be part of the growth stories of solo professionals and small businesses â€” helping turn ideas into real, working digital products: websites, apps, and tools that are clean, fast, and fully custom â€” without agency pricing or bloated frameworks.

## You bring the vision, Iâ€™ll bring the code. Letâ€™s grow *together*.
